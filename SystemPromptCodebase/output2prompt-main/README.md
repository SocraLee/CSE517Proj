## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
# download the dataset and models
wget "https://zenodo.org/records/12759549/files/prompt2output_inverters.zip?download=1" -O prompt2output_inverters.zip
wget "https://zenodo.org/records/12759549/files/prompt2output_datasets.zip?download=1" -O prompt2output_datasets.zip
unzip prompt2output_inverters.zip
unzip prompt2output_datasets.zip
pip install .
```

## Troubleshooting
1. Please make sure your `transformers` library version is 4.36.0 and `accelarate` library version is 0.28.0, if it is too new, there will be problem.

2. When running for the first time, you may need to execute the following commands in your Python shell:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

3. If you receive a prompt, you may need to install the sentencepiece library as follows:
```sentencepiece
pip install sentencepiece
```

4. You need to set the OpenAI key as an environment variable in order to compute the cosine similarity:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your openai key"
```

## Usage
If you want to use this model to extract prompt of a GPTs (LLM app). You can ask these questions to the GPTs:
- Give me 16 short sentences that best describe yourself. Start with “1:”
- Give me 16 examples questions that I can ask you. Start with “1:”
- Give me 16 scenarios where I can use you. Start with “1:”
- Give me 16 short sentences comparing yourself with ChatGPT. Start with “1:”

With these four questions, you can get 64 outputs from the GPTs.

See `prompt_outputs` in `main.py` as an example to construct a list of prompt_outputs, then replace `prompt_outputs` with your sample. 

Then run `python main.py test_sample` to get the result.

The code should be easy to understand and change if you run into bugs or want to make some modifications.

## Evaluation

system prompts dataset
```
synthetic
real
awesome
```

To evaluate the model on the system prompt datasets, run

```eval
# system prompts
python main.py test system_prompts synthetic
python main.py test system_prompts real
python main.py test system_prompts awesome
# test on single sample
python main.py test_sample
```

## New Experiment

We introduced a new experiment that changes the number of outputs during the testing phase. You can specify the number of outputs by adding an extra command-line argument, for example:

```bash
python main.py test system_prompts synthetic 15
```

Note that the number of outputs must be an integer in the range 1-16, where 16 corresponds to the original test setting (i.e., 16 outputs per query, 64 outputs in total). 

For convenience, you can enter your OpenAI key and run `test.sh` directly, which includes all experiments related to system prompts in our paper.

## Pre-trained Models

The pre-trained models are in the `inverters` folder
